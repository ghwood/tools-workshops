# Search and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

## Search

Default search available on IETF websites such as [www.ietf.org](www.ietf.org), [datatracker.ietf.org](datatracker.ietf.org), and [mailarchive.ietf.org](mailarchive.ietf.org) is relatively simple and advanced search options are incomplete and inconsistent. Moreover search and across IETF web properties is not available. 

Possible improvements include:

- integrated and configureable cross-site search,
- full text search of RFCs/I-Ds, and
- time and date based search.

## SEO
IETF websites do not fully employ readiliy available methods for improving how content they host is indexed by and made available via external search engines. Areas for consideration include:

+ sitemap.xml files
+ webpage metadata
+ page and site dynamics (site structure and load times)
  
Possible SEO objectives:

+ rfc-editor is the preferred result/source for RFCs
+ datatracker.ietf.org is the preferred result/source for I-Ds
+ www.ietf.org the preferred result/source for general information about the IETF
